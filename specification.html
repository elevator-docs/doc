<p>Create software for controlling <code class="inline">n</code> elevators working in parallel across <code class="inline">m</code> floors.</p>

  Main requirements
</h2>

<p>Be reasonable: There may be semantic hoops that you can jump through to create something that is &quot;technically correct&quot;. Do not hesitate to contact us if you feel that something is ambiguous or missing from these requirements.</p>
<h3 id="no-orders-are-lost" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#no-orders-are-lost" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  No orders are lost
</h3>

<ul>
<li>Once the light on a hall call button (buttons for calling an elevator to that floor; top 6 buttons on the control panel) is turned on, an elevator should arrive at that floor
</li>
<li>Similarly for a cab call (for telling the elevator what floor you want to exit at; front 4 buttons on the control panel), but only the elevator at that specific workspace should take the order
</li>
<li><p>This means handling network packet loss, losing network connection entirely, software that crashes, and losing power - both to the elevator motor and the machine that controls the elevator</p>
<ul>
<li>For cab orders, handling loss of power/software crash implies that the orders are executed once service is restored
</li>
<li>The time used to detect these failures should be reasonable, ie. on the order of magnitude of seconds (not minutes)
</li>
<li>Network packet loss is not an error, and can occur at any time
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If the elevator is disconnected from the network, it should still serve all the currently active orders (ie. whatever lights are showing)</p>
<ul>
<li>It should also keep taking new cab calls, so that people can exit the elevator even if it is disconnected from the network
</li>
<li>The elevator software should not require reinitialization (manual restart) after intermittent network or motor power loss
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multiple-elevators-should-be-more-efficient-than-one" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#multiple-elevators-should-be-more-efficient-than-one" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Multiple elevators should be more efficient than one
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The orders should be distributed across the elevators in a reasonable way</p>
<ul>
<li>Ex: If all three elevators are idle and two of them are at the bottom floor, then a new order at the top floor should be handled by the closest elevator (ie. neither of the two at the bottom).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are free to choose and design your own &quot;cost function&quot; of some sort: Minimal movement, minimal waiting time, etc.
</li>
<li>The project is not about creating the &quot;best&quot; or &quot;optimal&quot; distribution of orders. It only has to be clear that the elevators are cooperating and communicating.
</li>
</ul>

  <a href="#an-individual-elevator-should-behave-sensibly-and-efficiently" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  An individual elevator should behave sensibly and efficiently
</h3>

<ul>
<li>No stopping at every floor &quot;just to be safe&quot;
</li>
<li><p>The hall &quot;call upward&quot; and &quot;call downward&quot; buttons should behave differently</p>
<ul>
<li>Ex: If the elevator is moving from floor 1 up to floor 4 and there is a downward order at floor 3, then the elevator should not stop on its way upward, but should return back to floor 3 on its way down
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-lights-and-buttons-should-function-as-expected" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#the-lights-and-buttons-should-function-as-expected" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  The lights and buttons should function as expected
</h3>

<ul>
<li>The hall call buttons on all workspaces should let you summon an elevator
</li>
<li><p>Under normal circumstances, the lights on the hall buttons should show the same thing on all workspaces </p>
<ul>
<li>Under circumstances with high packet loss, at least one light must work as expected
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The cab button lights should not be shared between elevators
</li>
<li><p>The cab and hall button lights should turn on as soon as is reasonable after the button has been pressed</p>
<ul>
<li>Not ever turning on the button lights because &quot;no guarantee is offered&quot; is not a valid solution
</li>
<li>You are allowed to expect the user to press the button again if it does not light up
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The cab and hall button lights should turn off when the corresponding order has been serviced
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;door open&quot; lamp should be used as a substitute for an actual door, and as such should not be switched on while the elevator is moving</p>
<ul>
<li>The duration for keeping the door open should be in the 1-5 second range
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Start with <code class="inline">1 &lt;= n &lt;= 3</code> elevators, and <code class="inline">m == 4</code> floors. Try to avoid hard-coding these values: You should be able to add a fourth elevator with no extra configuration, or change the number of floors with minimal configuration. You do, however, not need to test for <code class="inline">n &gt; 3</code> and <code class="inline">m != 4</code>.</p>

  <a href="#unspecified-behaviour" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Unspecified behaviour
</h2>

<p>Some things are left intentionally unspecified. Their implementation will not be tested, and are therefore up to you.</p>
<p>Which orders are cleared when stopping at a floor</p>
<ul>
<li>You can clear only the orders in the direction of travel, or assume that everyone enters/exits the elevator when the door opens
</li>
</ul>
<p>How the elevator behaves when it cannot connect to the network (router) during initialization</p>
<ul>
<li>You can either enter a &quot;single-elevator&quot; mode, or refuse to start
</li>
</ul>
<p>How the hall (call up, call down) buttons work when the elevator is disconnected from the network</p>
<ul>
<li>You can optionally refuse to take these new orders
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stop button &amp; obstruction switch are disabled</p>
<ul>
<li>Their functionality (if/when implemented) is up to you.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="permitted-assumptions" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#permitted-assumptions" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Permitted assumptions
</h2>

<p>The following assumptions will always be true during testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one elevator is always working normally
</li>
<li><p>No multiple simultaneous errors: Only one error happens at a time, but the system must still return to a fail-safe state after this error</p>
<ul>
<li>(Recall that network packet loss is <em>not</em> an error in this context, and must be considered regardless of any other (single) error that can occur)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No network partitioning: There will never be a situation where there are multiple sets of two or more elevators with no connection between them
</li>
</ul>
